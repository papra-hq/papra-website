I'm thrilled to announce the release of Papra v0.8! This is a significant technical release that lays the foundation for exciting future features while improving the developer experience.

## Enhanced Webhook System

One of the biggest improvements in v0.8 is our completely overhauled webhook system. We've made it more powerful, reliable, and standards-compliant.

### Standard Webhook Compliance

**Breaking change**: We've updated our webhook format to comply with the [Standard Webhooks specification](https://www.standardwebhooks.com/). This brings several benefits, with the main benefit being ecosystem compatibility.

#### Migration Guide

If you're currently using webhooks, you'll need to update your webhook handlers:

**Before (v0.7 and earlier):**
```http
# Headers
x-signature: P8HFU+6SAJSczKQugKpx7aylbGoNH/RTyvLtgS7jzjA=
x-event: document:created

# Body
{
  "event": "document:created",
  "payload": {
    "documentId": "doc_hlrwbh2jz2gv851wwtib3ler",
    "organizationId": "org_eda48ocnvekbcj8q0enxybty",
    "name": "index (1).js",
    "createdAt": "2025-08-08T18:40:15.210Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-08-08T18:40:15.210Z"
  },
  "timestampMs": 1754678415223
}
```

**After (v0.8+):**
```http
# Headers
webhook-signature: v1,hQvJ5c3gKIx6NBXLXNWfXJgpLymHE+rXjQqML0DlaIA=
webhook-timestamp: 1754678128
webhook-id: msg_pb568hoi1t6n3k3fkfoc4u13

# Body
{
  "data": {
    "documentId": "doc_tny6ix8nort5ip05s6tl2efd",
    "organizationId": "org_eda48ocnvekbcj8q0enxybty",
    "name": "index.js",
    "createdAt": "2025-08-08T18:35:28.941Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-08-08T18:35:28.941Z"
  },
  "type": "document:created",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-08T18:35:28.966Z"
}
```

You can now use any standard webhook-compliant library, or our official [@papra/webhooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@papra/webhooks) package for easy webhook validation.


### New Webhook Events

We've expanded the webhook events you can subscribe to:

- **`document:updated`** - Triggered when document name or content changes
- **`document:tag:added`** - Triggered when a tag is added to a document  
- **`document:tag:removed`** - Triggered when a tag is removed from a document

### Improved Performance

Webhook invocations are now **deferred**, meaning they no longer block API responses. This significantly improves the responsiveness of all document operations while ensuring reliable webhook delivery.


## Task Processing with Cadence MQ

We've introduced **Cadence MQ**, our custom-built task runner designed specifically for self-hosting environments. Unlike traditional solutions like BullMQ that require Redis, Cadence MQ is built to be self-hosting friendly.

### What's Changed

- **File content extraction** (OCR, text extraction) now runs asynchronously, improving upload performance and reducing the format-specific processing time (image vs text for example)
- **Recurring maintenance tasks** (document cleanup, token expiration) are now handled by the task runner

This foundation enables us to add more background processing features in future releases while keeping Papra's infrastructure requirements minimal.

## Enhanced Migration System

We've completely rewritten our database migration mechanism to be more flexible and powerful:

- **JavaScript migrations** instead of SQL-only files
- **Up and down migrations** with full business logic support
- **Backward compatibility** with existing SQL migrations
- **Future-proof** foundation for complex schema changes

This technical improvement ensures Papra can evolve smoothly while maintaining data integrity across updates.

## Quality of Life Improvements

- **Better Error Handling**
    - **Improved feedback** for invalid origin config with [some documentation](https://docs.papra.app/resources/troubleshooting/#invalid-application-origin)
    - **Added error messages** when tag deletion fails
    - **Fixed tag deletion** issue when tags were assigned to documents
- **Enhanced Internationalization**: Added support for Italian and improved Romanian translation
- **Simplified organization member list** with a cleaner, more intuitive design
- **OCR for scanned pdfs**, finally!
