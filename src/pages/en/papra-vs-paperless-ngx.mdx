## Why Papra Exists

Paperless-NGX is an excellent, mature project with a large community and extensive features. If it works perfectly for your needs, that's great! However, Papra was created to address specific areas where improvements could be made:

- **User Experience**: Papra is built from the ground up to be intuitive and easy to use, with a focus on modern UI/UX principles
- **Collaboration**: Designed to make sharing documents with family members and teams easier with organizations and flexible permissions
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with horizontal scalability and cloud-native deployments in mind from day one
- **Developer Experience**: Provides modern tooling like a JavaScript SDK and comprehensive API documentation

If you're looking for something that prioritizes these aspects, Papra might be worth exploring.
