**Important**: This Privacy Policy applies exclusively to the managed cloud service hosted at **dashboard.papra.app** (the "Hosted Service"). This Privacy Policy does not apply to self-hosted instances of the Papra open-source software. Self-hosters act as independent data controllers and are solely responsible for their own privacy practices and GDPR compliance.

### 1. Information Collection
Papra collects the following personal data:
- Email addresses, names, and authentication details (email/password or Single Sign-On providers such as Google or GitHub).
- Usage and analytics data collected via PostHog (including IP addresses, pages visited, interactions, and usage patterns).
- Documents uploaded by users, including metadata (titles, descriptions, tags) and document content.

### 2. Purpose of Data Collection
Papra collects data to:
- Provide, operate, and maintain the services offered by Papra.
- Offer user support and address technical issues.
- Analyze usage to continuously improve our services.
- Perform marketing analysis and related activities (via PostHog).

### 3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies
Papra employs the following types of cookies and tracking technologies:
- **Strictly Necessary Cookies**: Required for platform functionality, user authentication, and session management. These cannot be disabled.
- **Analytics Cookies**: PostHog analytics to understand user behavior, track feature usage, and improve service quality. These cookies collect anonymized usage data.
- **Performance Cookies**: To monitor platform performance and identify technical issues.

You can manage your cookie preferences through your browser settings. However, disabling certain cookies may affect platform functionality. For more information about managing cookies, visit your browser's help documentation.

### 4. Data Storage and Security
All data collected by Papra is securely stored within Europe to ensure GDPR compliance. Papra implements industry-standard security measures including:
- Encryption of data in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest
- Regular security audits and updates
- Access controls and authentication mechanisms
- Secure backup procedures

However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### 5. Third-Party Providers
Papra uses the following trusted third-party services to operate and improve the platform:
- **Render**: Hosting infrastructure and application deployment

- **PostHog**: Analytics, product insights, and feature usage tracking
- **Stripe**: Payment processing for subscriptions (does not store card details on Papra servers)

All third-party providers are carefully selected based on their security practices and GDPR compliance. These providers only receive the minimum data necessary to perform their services.

### 6. Data Sharing and Transfer
Papra does not sell, rent, or trade user data to third parties for marketing purposes. Data sharing is limited to the following circumstances:
