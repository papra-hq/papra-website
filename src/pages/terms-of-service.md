Papra is an open-source document management platform managed by Corentin Thomasset. Contact email: contact@papra.app.

**Important**: These Terms of Service apply exclusively to the managed cloud service hosted at **dashboard.papra.app** (the "Hosted Service"). These Terms do not apply to self-hosted instances of the Papra open-source software.

### 2. Acceptance and Modification of Terms
- By accessing or using the Papra Hosted Service (dashboard.papra.app), users agree to these Terms.
- Papra reserves the right to update these Terms periodically. Significant changes will be communicated via email or through notifications on the dashboard.
