Papra is an open-source document management platform managed by Corentin Thomasset. Contact email: contact@papra.app.

**Important**: These Terms of Service apply exclusively to the managed cloud service hosted at **dashboard.papra.app** (the "Hosted Service"). These Terms do not apply to self-hosted instances of the Papra open-source software.

### 2. Acceptance and Modification of Terms
- By accessing or using the Papra Hosted Service (dashboard.papra.app), users agree to these Terms.
- Papra reserves the right to update these Terms periodically. Significant changes will be communicated via email or through notifications on the dashboard.

- Accounts must be secured by strong passwords.
- Users are fully responsible for activities conducted through their accounts.

### 4. Usage Policies
- Users agree not to utilize Papra for illegal activities, unauthorized distribution of protected materials, or hosting malicious content.

- **No Liability for Self-Hosted Use**: Corentin Thomasset and Papra are not responsible for any activities, data processing, security breaches, or legal compliance issues occurring within self-hosted instances. Self-hosters are solely responsible as independent data controllers.
- **Hosted Service Infrastructure**: The infrastructure, configurations, managed services, and any proprietary features specific to the Hosted Service (dashboard.papra.app) remain the intellectual property of Corentin Thomasset.
